features:

- detect midi keyboard input!
- make GUI piano and show answer there too?
- make controls for:
    - range of notes
    - max jump size (in semitones)
    - number of notes in melody
    - time between notes
- autoplay mode, generate melodies with time inbetween them
- show notes in centered boxes
    - first note shown immediately, others "?"
    - color notes as being played
    - let users click squares to hear that note
- make virtual keyboard for input as well?
- show notes in a staff?

technical:

- i should probably adopt a pattern like https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores:
```ts
function createStore<T>(initialState: T): Store<T> {
  let listeners = new Set<Listener<T>>()
  let state = initialState
  return {
    get() {
      return state
    },
    set(newState: T) {
      state = newState
      listeners.forEach(listener => listener(state))
    },
    subscribe(listener) {
      listeners.add(listener)
      return () => {
        listeners.delete(listener)
      }
    }
  }
}
```
