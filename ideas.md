features:

- detect midi keyboard input!
- make GUI piano and show answer there too?
- make controls for:
  - range of notes
  - max jump size (in semitones)
  - number of notes in melody
  - time between notes
- autoplay mode, generate melodies with time inbetween them
- show notes in centered boxes
  - first note shown immediately, others "?"

^ old notes above, now i changed the app entirely

features:

- preset buttons for "novice", "intermediate", "advanced"
  X speed in BPM
- show visualization of tempo
- explore other sounds?
- control range of notes
- intervals (list allowed intervals!) .. maybe checkboxes and +/-
  - imagine someone wants to practice M3rds on their instrument... they could set intervals to [1, 4] to allow M3rds (and semitones to break up cycles)
- make mode without interval that waits for you to play note on MIDI keyboard!
- give melodies in bursts! (like 4 notes at a time)

show off:

- link on page: How it works (video)
  - demo it and give some tips on using it
- maybe other musicians would be interested in this?
- the pitch: "i wanted to practice my ear training, and couldn't find a tool that worked the way i wanted, so i made my own! i think it could be useful for other musicians too, so i put it on the web for others to use too! totally free, no ads."
